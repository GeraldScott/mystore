# Develop a simple mystore app using the Angular framework

**Angular/Bootstrap: two workshops**

This repo contains materials from my two workshops. 
"Angular Applied"  contains instructions and slides of my 3-hour workshop where we build an app with Angular and Bootstrap with the hard-coded data on the client.  "Angular for Java Devs" is a one-hour workshop  where the Angular app gets the data from a Spring Boot server.

If you're interested in Angular training or consulting, send an email to info @ faratasystems.com.
